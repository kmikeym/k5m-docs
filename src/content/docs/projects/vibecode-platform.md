# VibeCode Platform

**Live at**: https://vibecode.quarterly.systems

Build functional applications without writing code. VibeCode turns ideas into working prototypes through intuitive visual development.

## What It Does

VibeCode is an experimental no-code/low-code platform that lets you create applications by describing what you want, not how to build it. It combines visual development with AI assistance to accelerate the journey from concept to working software.

Think of it as business-grade vibe coding - transforming ideas into systems through intuitive frameworks instead of traditional programming.

## Who It's For

- **Non-technical founders** who want to prototype products
- **Product managers** testing ideas before investing in development
- **Designers** creating interactive prototypes
- **Developers** who want rapid prototyping for client demos
- **Entrepreneurs** validating business concepts quickly

## How to Use It

### Getting Started

1. Visit https://vibecode.quarterly.systems
2. Start with a blank project or template
3. Describe what you want to build
4. Watch VibeCode generate the foundation
5. Refine and customize through the visual interface

### Building Applications

**Visual Development**
- Drag and drop components
- Configure behavior without code
- See changes in real-time
- Test as you build

**AI Assistance**
- Describe features in plain language
- Get component suggestions
- Auto-generate common patterns
- Refine through conversation

**Local-First Data**
- Built on Fireproof database
- Works offline automatically
- Syncs when connected
- Your data stays private

## What You Can Build

### Business Applications
- Internal dashboards
- Data collection forms
- Admin panels
- Workflow tools

### Prototypes & MVPs
- Product demos
- Client presentations
- User testing versions
- Concept validation

### Personal Projects
- Habit trackers
- Personal dashboards
- Collection managers
- Learning tools

## Best Practices

### Starting a Project
- **Start simple** - Build core functionality first
- **Test early** - Validate ideas before adding complexity
- **Iterate fast** - Make changes, test, repeat
- **Don't over-engineer** - Perfect is the enemy of done

### Working with AI
- **Be specific** - "Add a task list" vs "Add productivity features"
- **Iterate** - Refine suggestions through follow-ups
- **Review output** - AI helps, but you decide
- **Learn patterns** - Understand what works for reuse

### Building for Users
- **Focus on workflow** - How will people actually use this?
- **Keep it simple** - Fewer features done well beats many done poorly
- **Get feedback early** - Show real users ASAP
- **Iterate based on use** - Watch how people interact

## Common Questions

**Do I need to know how to code?**
No! That's the point. You describe what you want, and VibeCode helps you build it.

**What if I DO know how to code?**
Even better - you can drop into code when needed, but use visual tools for speed.

**Is this production-ready?**
VibeCode is in beta - great for prototypes and MVPs. For production apps, consider migrating to traditional development.

**What happens to my data?**
Everything is local-first. Data stays on your device unless you explicitly sync it.

**Can I export my project?**
VibeCode projects are built on open standards. You own your code and data.

**How is this different from other no-code tools?**
VibeCode focuses on rapid iteration and AI-assisted development rather than template-based building.

## Tips & Tricks

### Rapid Prototyping
- Build the happy path first
- Skip edge cases initially
- Use placeholder data
- Focus on user experience

### Validation Workflow
1. Build minimum testable version (1-2 days)
2. Show 5 real users
3. Collect feedback
4. Iterate or pivot
5. Repeat

### When to Move to Code
- You've validated product-market fit
- Need custom integrations
- Performance becomes critical
- Team grows beyond early stage

### Collaboration
- Share projects for feedback
- Iterate based on live demos
- Use it for client presentations
- Prototype before writing specs

## Learning Path

**Week 1**: Build simple apps
- Todo list
- Note taker
- Contact manager

**Week 2**: Add complexity
- Data relationships
- Multi-screen flows
- Basic logic

**Week 3**: Polish
- User experience
- Error handling
- Edge cases

**Week 4**: Real project
- Solve actual problem
- Get real feedback
- Iterate based on use

## Understanding Limitations

**VibeCode is Great For:**
- Prototypes and MVPs
- Internal tools
- Proof of concepts
- Learning and experimentation

**Not Ideal For:**
- Complex enterprise systems (yet)
- High-performance applications
- Systems requiring custom APIs
- Mission-critical production apps

**Sweet Spot:**
- Validate ideas quickly
- Build internal tools
- Create demos and prototypes
- Test product concepts

## Getting Help

**Stuck on something?**
- Check the public demo at vibes.diy
- Experiment with different prompts
- Start over if needed - it's fast
- Ask specific questions

**Found a bug?**
VibeCode is in beta - bugs happen. Note what you were doing and try a workaround.

**Want a feature?**
This is an experimental platform. Focus on what you can do today rather than what's missing.
