# The Body Electric

**Live at**: https://body.quarterly.systems

A weight tracking app that cuts through daily fluctuations to show you what's really happening with your weight trends.

## What It Does

Most weight apps frustrate you with daily ups and downs caused by water retention, meal timing, and other noise. The Body Electric uses statistical smoothing (EWMA) to reveal your *actual* weight trend, helping you make better decisions about diet and fitness.

It also estimates your calorie surplus or deficit based on trend changes, giving you actionable insights without complicated food logging.

## Who It's For

- **Anyone tracking weight** who's tired of seeing random daily swings
- **Fitness enthusiasts** who want to understand true progress
- **People on diets** who need accurate feedback on what's working
- **Data-minded individuals** who appreciate science-based metrics

## How to Use It

### Daily Weigh-Ins

1. Visit https://body.quarterly.systems
2. Weigh yourself at the same time each day (morning is best)
3. Enter your weight
4. Check your trend line, not the daily number

### Understanding the Charts

**Raw Weight** (the bumpy line)
- Your actual daily measurements
- Will jump around - this is normal
- Don't make decisions based on this alone

**Trend Weight** (the smooth line)
- Your statistical "true" weight
- Filters out water weight and fluctuations
- Use this to track real progress

**Calorie Delta**
- Estimated daily calorie surplus/deficit
- Based on trend changes, not daily jumps
- Helps adjust your diet without counting every calorie

### Reading Your Progress

✅ **Trend going down steadily?** Your diet is working
❌ **Daily weight up but trend down?** Just water - stay the course
⚠️ **Trend plateauing?** Time to adjust your approach
📈 **Trend matches your goal?** You're dialed in perfectly

## Best Practices

### Weighing Yourself
- **Same time daily** - First thing in the morning after bathroom
- **Same conditions** - Before eating, after bathroom, minimal clothing
- **Don't skip days** - More data = better trends
- **Ignore single days** - Only the trend matters

### Using the Data
- **Wait 1-2 weeks** before judging if something is working
- **Trust the trend** over how you feel day-to-day
- **Adjust based on trend** not daily fluctuations
- **Be patient** - Real changes take time to show

### Goal Setting
- Healthy weight loss: 1-2 lbs per week (trend)
- Maintenance: Trend stays flat
- Muscle gain: Slow upward trend (0.5-1 lb/week)

## Common Questions

**Why does my weight jump around so much?**
Water retention, food in your system, sodium intake, and hormones all cause daily swings of 2-5 lbs. That's normal!

**How long until I see my trend?**
You'll see a trend line immediately, but wait 5-7 days for it to become meaningful.

**What if I miss a day?**
Not ideal, but the trend will still work. Just weigh yourself as soon as you remember.

**Is my data private?**
Yes! Everything stays on your device in your browser. No cloud sync, no accounts, complete privacy.

**Can I use pounds or kilograms?**
Both are supported - choose your preferred unit.

**What's EWMA?**
Exponentially Weighted Moving Average - a statistical method that smooths noisy data while staying responsive to real changes. You don't need to understand it for it to work!

## Tips & Tricks

### Don't Panic About
- 2-3 lb daily swings (especially for women during monthly cycles)
- Weight going up after salty meals
- Higher weight after intense workouts (muscle inflammation)
- Weekend weight spikes (usually water)

### Do Pay Attention To
- Trend direction over 1-2 weeks
- Trend speed (is it too fast or too slow?)
- Calorie delta matching your goals
- How you feel + what the trend shows

### Advanced Usage
- Take body measurements weekly (waist, etc.) as another data point
- Note workouts/diet changes to correlate with trend shifts
- Screenshot trends to track long-term progress
- Export data if you want to analyze elsewhere

## Making Adjustments

**If trend isn't moving and you want to lose weight:**
- Reduce daily calories by 200-300
- Wait 2 weeks to see trend response
- Adjust again if needed

**If trend is dropping too fast (>2 lbs/week):**
- Increase calories slightly
- Ensure you're eating enough protein
- Consider if it's sustainable

**If trend is perfect:**
- Don't change anything!
- Keep doing what's working
